To better understand the root causes of business questions, a Fishbone diagram was constructed. The dataset schema was designed to align with business objectives and data normalization standards. A data lake was designed in AWS S3 with appropriate folder structures, tags, and region specifications. VPC, EC2 instances, and Security Groups were configured to ensure a secure and scalable analysis environment.
